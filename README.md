Analysis of COVID19 outbreak using data mining techniques

## Task 3 (a): Clustering hospitals according to their bed capacity

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several organisations have made the datasets available to know more about the outbreak and take informed decisions. The “usa_hospital_beds” data set, containing bed details of 6626 hospitals in the USA, is one such dataset. Each record in the dataset represents a hospital with 18 attributes.<br>

Task<br>
Suppose a crisis management board has been initiated and wants to learn the hospital characteristics in terms of their capabilities to handle the high utilization event of COVID- 19. Your task is to conduct clustering on this data set and describe the minimum number of effective clusters identified.<br>

## Task 3 (b): Association mining to find hotspots based on a PatentRoute Data
During the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in South Korea, the routes travelled by positive patients were reported. The “PatientRoute” dataset consists of 6714 observations with each observation presents a positive patient’s visit at a location and the time. There are a total of 1211 unique patients and 174 unique locations.<br>

Task<br>
Consider each patients’ route as a transaction and build an association mining model on this dataset to identify what are the common routes that positive patients have travelled.<br>
