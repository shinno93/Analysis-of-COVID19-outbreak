Analysis of COVID19 outbreak using data mining techniques

## Task 2: Identifying potential COVID-19 positive patients and their characteristics

A subset of the COVID-19 hospitalization dataset with 111 attributes about the patients hospitalized in doubt for COVID-19 in a hospital in Brazil has been provided.<br>
The hospital wants to identify potential COVID-19 positive-case patients and their characteristics. This will help the hospital to focus on intensive treatment towards the most vulnerable patients and prepare for additional necessary medical facilities including
medicines, intensive care units’ beds, staff, etc.<br>
<br>
Task<br>
The task is to
(1) predict if the patient is positive to COVID-19 based on the characteristics recorded in the dataset, and (2) inform the hospital the prominent characteristics of COVID-19 patients and insight with this dataset for making informed decisions. <br>



## Task 3 (a): Clustering hospitals according to their bed capacity

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several organisations have made the datasets available to know more about the outbreak and take informed decisions. The “usa_hospital_beds” data set, containing bed details of 6626 hospitals in the USA, is one such dataset. Each record in the dataset represents a hospital with 18 attributes.<br>

Task<br>
Suppose a crisis management board has been initiated and wants to learn the hospital characteristics in terms of their capabilities to handle the high utilization event of COVID- 19. Your task is to conduct clustering on this data set and describe the minimum number of effective clusters identified.<br>

## Task 3 (b): Association mining to find hotspots based on a PatentRoute Data
During the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in South Korea, the routes travelled by positive patients were reported. The “PatientRoute” dataset consists of 6714 observations with each observation presents a positive patient’s visit at a location and the time. There are a total of 1211 unique patients and 174 unique locations.<br>

Task<br>
Consider each patients’ route as a transaction and build an association mining model on this dataset to identify what are the common routes that positive patients have travelled.<br>
